# neptune plugin template
This is a repository template for a neptune plugin monorepo.

Each plugin in the `plugins/` directory will be automatically built by running `pnpm run build` to their respective `dist/` folder.

## credits
- a lot of the inspiration, plus everything in plugins/_lib/ is from [Inrixia's](https://github.com/Inrixia) [neptune-plugins repo](https://github.com/Inrixia/neptune-plugins).
